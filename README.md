Recipes project

Recipes website with three recipes: Roast Beef, Viking Bread, and Viking Blood Mead.












My first project based on The Odin's Project HTML project, but I decided to add styling by using CSS. Before this project, I did not have any experience using CSS. In order to use it, I wend through CSS Crash Course by Traversy Media on YouTube.
It was a hard, but an interesting experience. Googling, trying to understand someone's code and what I can use in order to make it my own way...

NOTE: I don't owe any rights on pictures that I used for this project, I did not compose description(only edit it). This website was created for learning purposes.
