                        Drank by Vikings and their Norse Gods, sometimes even referred to as Nectar of the Gods, 
                        mead has been around for centuries and is possibly the world’s oldest alcoholic drink.
                        Vikings Blood Mead Recipe is a rich and delicious mead in Denmark. It is a drink that comes with vibrant red color. 
                        The Vikings used to enjoy their mead with this blood mead.

                <ul>
                    <li>5 gallons water</li>
                    <li>25 lbs honey</li>
                    <li>.5 oz Centennial Hop Pellets</li>
                    <li>7 oz dried hibiscus</li>
                    <li>2 packets of Lalvin 71B White Wine Yeast</li>
                    <li>1 tsp. of Wyeast Brewer Choice Yeast Nutrient (¼ tsp at four separate times)</li>
                    <li>1/4 tsp. Potassium Metabisulfite</li>
                    <li>2 1/2 tsp. Potassium Sorbate</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="h2">Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make a hibiscus tea with 1.5 gallons of water. Bring to a boil then turn off and allow hibiscus to steep for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>During this time, pour honey into the other 3.5 gallons of water.</li>
                    <li>After 30 minutes, strain the hibiscus flowers from the pot and stir the tea into your honey water.</li>
                    <li>Once the mixture reaches 70 degrees, pitch your yeast and add 1/4 tsp of the yeast nutrient.</li>
                    <li>At 24, 48, and 72 hours after pitching yeast, slowly stir mead and add 1/4 tsp of yeast nutrient. Adding yeast nutrient will cause a reaction, be sure to have enough headspace for activity or use a blow-off tube.</li>
                    <li>After two weeks, transfer mead to secondary and dry hop with 0.5 oz Centennial hops.</li>
                    <li>Leave hopped mead for one week and transfer again.</li>
                    <li>Additional transfers after this will allow dead yeast to settle out each time, prevent yeast autolysis (leading to off-flavors), and improve clarity.</li>
                    <li>Stabilize mead with potassium metabisulfite and potassium sorbate.</li>
                    <li>Bottle your mead and wait! Using smaller bottles allows for more testing as you wait months/years. Try a bottle at six months, one year, and two years. You’ll be amazed at the difference as the strong alcohol presence mellows and other flavors emerge.</li>
                </ol>
